<meta name="description" content="I am presently working at Deepsync Technologies as a Machine Learning Engineer. I completed my B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), India in June 2020. Among all technologies and development in various fields, I am inclined to explore further the world of Digital Signal Processing and Deep Learning. In my final year project at VIT, I have worked on applications of Deep Learning in Communication Systems. My current research is in the field of Generative Neural Speech Synthesis, and Deep Learning.

Besides academics, I am fond of exploring various art techniques and cultures. I love to paint and practice music (Violin) during my free hours. I connect well with Bob Dylan’s songs. I believe, everything around you beholds the answer to all your complex queries.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research or have any questions. I am more than happy to hear from you! Wohoo/>
